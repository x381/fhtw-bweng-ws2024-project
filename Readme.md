# HAKart: Backend Web Engineering Project

This repository contains the backend implementation for **HAKart**, an online marketplace. The project was created as part of the **Backend Web Engineering (BWENG)** course to demonstrate expertise in developing robust, secure, and scalable backend systems using modern development practices.

---

## üöÄ Motivation


**HAKart** serves as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed for the **Clean Backend Competition**. It showcases:
- **RESTful API design** with proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- Seamless integration with a frontend from the Frontend Web Engineering course.
- **JWT-based authentication** and role-based access control.
- Secure, maintainable, and future-proof backend development using modern tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java Spring Boot**: Framework for scalable REST API development.
- **Docker**: Simplified deployment with containerized applications.
- **MySQL (MariaDB)**: Relational database for reliable data persistence.
- **MinIO**: Object storage solution for file management (e.g., images).
- **Swagger**: Auto-generated API documentation and testing.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure user authentication and authorization.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework to ensure 80%+ code coverage.

## üìã Features and Functional Requirements

### General Requirements:
- Adherence to RESTful principles with proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- Input validation and clear error messages.
- Use of JSON for data exchange (except for file uploads).
- Minimum of **80% test coverage** using unit and integration tests.

### Key Functionalities:

#### Public (Anonymous) Users:
- View homepage content, including the latest products and blog entries.

#### Registered Users:
- **Register** with:
    - Salutation
    - Valid email address
    - Username (min. 5 characters)
    - Password (min. 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and numbers)
    - Country (ISO code)
    - Profile picture (or default placeholder if not provided)
- **Manage Content**:
    - Create, update, and delete products and blog entries.
    - Manage their own orders.
    - Edit personal data and passwords.

#### Admins:
- Oversee all platform data, including users, products, and orders.
- Full control to edit or delete user data and content.

#### Product Management:
- CRUD operations for products with file upload support for images.
- Filter and sort products by category, creation date, and creator.

#### Security:
- JWT-based authentication.
- Role-based access control for endpoints (users vs. admins).
